# weather-display-app

## Task Description

I will build a weather dashboard app that will display the current and the future 5 days forecast weather conditions of a requested city by the user .
When the user enters his desired city into the app and searches ,
he will be presented with a detailed weather result.
one part of the result will be the current detailed weather condition and the other section of the result will be information about the next 5 days' weather forecast .
The past searched cities by the users will be saved on one section of the dashboard. This will improve the user experience of the app by allowing the user to just click on the previously searched city to get the same weather information as previously using the search method.
